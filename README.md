# mania2fnf
A simple command line based osu!mania to FNF converter. 
Long notes are NOT supported yet due to the parsed used (POSSIBLY FIXED)

# Installation & usage
- Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone the repository
- ~~Run npm install~~ no longer required due to custom release of osu!parser
- Run node index.js with the .osu file as an argument (file path, NOT THE FILE)
- Enjoy the outcome.

By default, it replaces Whitty's Ballistic. This will be changed soon.

## YOU WILL NEED TO CONVERT THE AUDIO YOURSELF, THIS IS ONLY FOR .OSU FILES
